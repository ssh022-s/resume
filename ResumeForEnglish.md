| 2022.7 - 2022.10 | High-speed camera acquisition and storage software development |

* **Project Description：** Use the C++ language MFC module to develop a set of real-time acquisition, storage and synchronization control processing programs for sequence images based on high-speed cameras to achieve real-time acquisition, efficient transmission and lossless storage of high-speed sequence images by the main computer and industrial computer. , the synchronization control module ensures that the collected left and right images are synchronized.
* **Use site：** C++、MFC、OpenCV、python。
* **Personal Responsibilities**：
 1. Complete the development of high-speed camera software and realize 500fps/s real-time image acquisition, transmission and lossless storage, and use the memory circular buffer to buffer the collected data.
 2. Realize frame-skipping playback and landmark point detection of multiple frames of collected images, and use the neural network model and improved QR code camera calibration method to automatically identify landmark points in the image and automatically calibrate the camera.
 3. Realize automatic image collection, camera calibration, landmark point recognition, and export landmark point displacement functions to automatically calculate the displacement, speed, acceleration and other parameters of the landmark point.
 4. In addition, the collection and storage are accelerated through FPGA. The high-speed sequence data is temporarily stored through the FPGA module. The data is transmitted through the PCIE interface at high speed. The data is stored efficiently through the memory circular buffer.
